# Research: Historical Context of Czesława's Portrait

This document captures the research needed to ground the memorial exhibit in factual accuracy and deepen our understanding of Czesława Kwoka's story.

**Key Research Questions:**

1. **Who was Wilhelm Brasse?**
   - What was his background before imprisonment?
   - Why was he assigned to the *Erkennungsdienst* (identification service) at Auschwitz?
   - How did he later describe the experience of photographing Czesława and other prisoners?

2. **What was the *Erkennungsdienst*?**
   - What was its official purpose within the camp system?
   - What procedures did it follow when photographing new arrivals?
   - How many photographs were taken, and how many have survived?

3. **What do we know about Czesława's life before deportation?**
   - Where was she born, and what was her family situation?
   - Under which Nazi operation was she arrested (e.g., *Generalplan Ost*, Zamość displacements)?
   - What was the timeline of her deportation: transit camp, arrival at Auschwitz, date of death?

4. **The photograph itself:**
   - What are the technical details (format, medium, current location of the original)?
   - What visible marks or signs in the image tell us about her treatment (e.g., the swollen lip from a guard's blow)?
   - How has this photograph been used in post‑war Holocaust education and memorialization?

5. **Broader historical context:**
   - What was the fate of Polish children in Auschwitz?
   - How does Czesława’s story fit into the larger narrative of the Zamość expulsions and the Nazi plan for “Lebensraum”?

**Research Sources:**
- Archival materials from the Auschwitz‑Birkenau State Museum.
- Testimonies of Wilhelm Brasse (interviews, written accounts).
- Historical studies on the *Erkennungsdienst* and Nazi photography.
- Monographs on the Zamość region during the occupation.

*This research will form the foundation of the exhibit’s first section, `01_Historical-Record`.*
