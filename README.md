# The Czesława Kwoka Digital Memorial Exhibit

## A Space for Remembrance, Education, and Advocacy

This repository serves as a curated digital memorial to honor **Czesława Kwoka**, a 14-year-old Polish girl who was murdered in the Auschwitz concentration camp in 1943. Her portrait, taken by prisoner‑photographer Wilhelm Brasse, has become one of the most haunting and humanizing images of the Holocaust.

### Purpose
*   **To Remember** Czesława not as a mere statistic, but as a person—a child with a name, a story, and a stolen future.
*   **To Educate** about the individual lives destroyed by genocide and the systematic cruelty of the Nazi identification service (*Erkennungsdienst*).
*   **To Advocate** for human rights and dignity, drawing a direct line from historical atrocity to contemporary injustice.

### A Brief Biography of Czesława Kwoka

Czesława Kwoka was born on 15 August 1928 in Wólka Złojecka, a village in occupied Poland. In December 1942, she and her mother, Katarzyna, were forcibly transported to the Zamość transit camp as part of the Nazi *Generalplan Ost*. In March 1943 they were deported to Auschwitz‑Birkenau.

Upon arrival, Czesława was registered as prisoner number **26947**. Wilhelm Brasse, a Polish political prisoner ordered to photograph new arrivals, captured her portrait shortly after she had been struck by a guard. The resulting image—a young girl with a swollen lip, frightened yet defiant eyes, and a shaved head—has survived as a testament to her stolen youth and the brutality she endured.

Czesława died in Auschwitz on 12 March 1943, at the age of 14. The official cause listed was “general weakness” (*allgemeine Schwäche*), a euphemism for the starvation, disease, and deliberate neglect that killed countless prisoners.
